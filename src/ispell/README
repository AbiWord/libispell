Ispell Enchant Backend

Ispell is as old as time. I'll bore you with the history lesson - let it
suffice to say that there are many forks of Ispell floating around there.

This is based off of work done by myself (Dom) and others inside of AbiWord
(http://www.abisource.com). It is a port of Ispell to C++, some other general
modifications, plus it's stateful (no static/global data). These are all good
things.

The current version of enchant looks for dictionary files in 2 places:

1) Global directory - this is $prefix/share/enchant/ispell/
2) User-local directory - this is $home/.enchant/ispell/

The user's dictionaries, if present, always take precedence over the global
ones.

You can grab dictionaries compatible with this version of Ispell from:
